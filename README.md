'start' button         --> print the sudoku puzzle and a 'check', 'exit', 'clear' and 'show solution' button
'check' button         --> check whether all entries are valid. 
                           If some entries is not filled, "Finish before check" is printed to the top of screen, 
                           otherwise it will tell which entry is wrong.
                           If every entries is correct, it will print "Congratulation!! You got it!!"
'exit' button          --> exit the program 
'clear' button         --> clear all entries
'show solution' button --> used a sudoku solver to get answer and print answer to entries
                           so the solution will depend on the user's previous entries
 
 P.S. considered adding difficulty levels and a restart button but have to move on to other projects first
